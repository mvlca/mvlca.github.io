            <p>Voluntary Labour Compliance Assessment (VLCA) is a labor standards assessment tool made by collaboration between Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association (MGMA) and <a href="https://www.ilo.org/actemp/about-us/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=ACT%2FEMP%20seeks%20to%20foster,democracy%20and%20socio%2Deconomic%20development.">The Bureau for Employers' Activities (ACT/EMP)</a> of <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization (ILO)</a>. The tool can provide an in-depth look at the company's performance against national labor laws and international labor standards for the employers especially in manufacturing industry in order that they can do self-assessment on their own compliance of national labor law using this tool.</p>
